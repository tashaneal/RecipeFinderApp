# RecipeFinderApp
Project Brief: 
A meal-planning/ recipe app that provides curated healthy recipes.  I was inspired to create this app to help my father find safe, delicious meal options.  He has stage 3 kidney and is often frustrated when trying to decide what to eat.  I created a database using MongoDB with a variety of foods for individuals with health conditions. 

Features included:
Analyze text and display useful information about it.
Visualize data in a user-friendly way. 
Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something in your app.
Interact with a database to store and retrieve information.


To run this project, install it locally using npm:
$ npm install
$ npm start
